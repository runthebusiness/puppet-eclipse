eclipse

This class installs eclipse, eclipse plug ins and allows for management of projects and workspaces via puppet.

Here is an example of how use this code in our own manifests:

	# install eclipse indigo and the plugins we use in our own deployments (working in debian squeeze)
	eclipse::package::phpdelux{"eclipseplusplugins":}

	# Import project
	eclipse::project::phpsvn{"eclipsephpandsvnproject":
      projectname=>[project name],
      workspacepath=>[path to workspace],
      path=>[path to project folder],
      group=>[group ownership of folder],
      owner=>[user ownership of folder],
      mode=>[file permissions of folder],
      require=>Eclipse::Package::Phpdelux["eclipseplusplugins"]
    }

	# Fix any issues that happen with the workspace
	eclipse::fixworkspace{"eclipsefixworkspace":
	    workspacepath=>[path to work space],
	    owner=>[user ownership of folder],
	    group=>[group ownership of folder],
	    mode=>[file permissions of folder],
      	require=>Eclipse::Project::Phpsvn["eclipsephpandsvnproject"]
 	}

See comment blocks of the code for further documentation.

We are happy to accept improvements to this project (bug reports/fixes, new built in plug in support, extended functionality, etc).

This module has been tested in debian squeeze, if you use it in another flavor and it works fine as is or if you have improvements to the eclipse::params class to allow it to work in your flavor please let us know.

Known Issues

1) When a newer version of a plug in is available than the one currently installed eclipse some times this will generate an error from command line. We cache our plugins to make sure that this issue does not occur.
